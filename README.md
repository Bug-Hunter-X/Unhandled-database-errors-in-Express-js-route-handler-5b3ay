This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within asynchronous database operations. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where a database query lacks proper error handling, potentially leading to server crashes or unexpected responses. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version, incorporating robust error handling to gracefully manage potential database errors.
